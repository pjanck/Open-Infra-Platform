# Summary

> TODO: A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, *non-specialist* audience.

TUM OpenInfraPlatform (OIP) is a Software-as-a-Service providing an open source application for
 viewing and analysis of different digital models used in the civil engineering field.

OIP supports reading and visualization of:

- Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) models as specified in ISO 16739
- Point Cloud Data (PCD) models as supported by the Cloud Compare library

Multiple models can be loaded at once and compared between each other.

Additionally, OIP incorporates its own EXPRESS parser to automatically generate early-binding code for IFC [Hecht:2019:FBI].
